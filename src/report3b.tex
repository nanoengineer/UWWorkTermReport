% example.tex - an example workterm report that can be used as a template for writing NE
% workterm reports

% We begin by calling the workreport class which includes all the definitions for the macros
% and environments we will be using throughout the document.
\documentclass{workreport}

% We will use some packages to add some functionality to our script.
% The lipsum package is only used to create placeholder text for this example. It can be
% deleted when your own text has been filled into the sections.
\usepackage{lipsum}
% The amsmath package provides various features to facilitate writing math formulas.
\usepackage{amsmath}


% LaTeX also supports file splitting between documents. For example, your
% introduction section could be in its own "introduction.tex" file, and you
% can import it here. This is normally done with the \input command.

% The \addbibresource command finds a BiBLaTeX file, and adds it to the
% document. BiBLatex and BiBTex are TeX extensions that automatically build
% format citations and references based on a key-value database sitting in a
% text file. In our case, this file is example.bib. We add this to the preamble
% (the part of the tex file before \begin{document}) here.
\addbibresource{./example.bib}

% The \begin{frontmatter} command will allow the use of the following environments:
% letter_of_submittal, contributions, summary, conclusions, recommendations, toctree
% (table of contents) and listoffiguresandtables (list of figures and list of tables).
\begin{frontmatter}

% The letter_of_submittal environment requires two inputs, the first being the greeting
% and the second being the closing.
\begin{letter_of_submittal}{Dear Dr. Tang:}{Sincerely,}

	% You're letter body.

%%%%%%
% BODY  %
%%%%%%

% The \begin{body} command will create the body environment. This environment
% includes the formatting required for the body
\begin{body}

% The \section{title} command creates a section in the body of your report. You must
% specify the title of the section as the commands input. These sections headers will
% automatically be added to the table of contents.
\section{Introduction}

	\lipsum[1-6]

\section{Background}

	\lipsum[1-2]-

% The \subsection{title} command creates a subsection for the above mentioned
% section. You must specify the title of the section as the commands input. These
% subsection headers will automatically be added to the table of contents, below the
% proper section.
\subsection{A Subsection}

	\lipsum[1]

	\lipsum[2]

% The \subsubsection{title} command works exactly like the \section{title} and
% \subsection{title} commands above.

\subsubsection{Sub-ception}

	\lipsum[1]

	BWOOOONG!

\section{Data}

	\lipsum[1-2]

% The \ref{reference} command will create a reference to any \label command.
Here's a reference to table \ref{tbl:exampletable}

% The table environment is used to create a table. Note that by calling this environment,
% this table will automatically be added to the list of tables.
\begin{table}

	% The \centering command centres the table.
	\centering

	% The tabular environment creates the table itself. For more information
	% and options when using this environment, refer to the link under Tables provided
	% in README.md.

		title & number & decimal \\ \hline
		heading & 1 & 1.7 \\ \hline
		another heading & 2 & 3.4 \\ \hline

	% The \caption{title} command adds a caption to your table. This caption will then
	% be used in the list of tables.
	\caption{A table demonstrating \LaTeX \, formatting}

	% The \label{title} command creates a reference that can be used to refer to this
	% table in the document. An example of this can be found on line 174.

\section{Math}

	\lipsum[1]

\subsection{The Bloch Equations}

	% The align environment is an important environment when writing out multiple
	% mathematical equations. It is used when vertical alignment is desired. Usually
	% binary relations, such as equal signs, are aligned.
	\begin{align}
		% The following are mathematical equations written using the amsmath
		% package. For more information on writing mathematical equations in
		% LaTeX, refer to the link under AMSMath in README.md.
		\frac{d\, M_x(t)}{dt} &= \gamma(\mathbf{M}(t) \times \mathbf{B}(t))_x - \frac{M_x(t)}{T_2} \\
		\frac{d\, M_y(t)}{dt} &= \gamma(\mathbf{M}(t) \times \mathbf{B}(t))_y - \frac{M_y(t)}{T_2} \\
		\frac{d\, M_z(t)}{dt} &= \gamma(\mathbf{M}(t) \times \mathbf{B}(t))_z - \frac{M_z(t) - M_0}{T_1}
	\end{align}

\subsection{The Schrodinger Equation}

	% The equation environment is used when only one equation needs to be written.
	\begin{equation}
		i\hbar \frac{\partial \, \Psi}{\partial t} = \hat{H}\Psi
	\end{equation}

\section{Graphics}

	Here's a stock image of a computer. It comes with a CC0 license, enabling
	free distribution for commercial and personal use. It's a JPEG.

	% The figure environment allows for the insertion of a figure into a LaTeX
	% document. By creating this environment, the figure will be automatically be added
	% to the list of figures. For more information on inserting figures, refer to the link
	% under Figures in README.md.
	\begin{figure}[!ht]
		\centering
		\label{fig:stock_computer}
		\includegraphics[width=5cm]{./stock-image.jpg}
		\caption{A stock computer, I just wanted a picture here}
	\end{figure}

\section{Conclusions}

	% The \gls{title} command allows the LaTeX document to keep track of where words
	% in the glossary are used. For more information on the glossary and acronyms,
	% refer to the link under Glossary and Acronyms in README.md.
	\gls{LaTeX} is awesome.

\section{Recommendations}

	Use more \LaTeX. Also, use more \gls{Unix}. Also, citations like
    	\cite{schweiger_principles_2001} will lead to a better quality of work.

%%%%%%%%%%%
%  BACK MATTER  %
%%%%%%%%%%%

% The \begin{backmatter} command will create the backmatter environment. This
% environment includes the formatting required for the body, as well as the the

% backmatter environment. This environment is where the glossary, references, and appendices are inserted. You, the user, don't have to worry about inserting references or glossaries. These are built for you at compile-time from the \cite and \gls flags that you placed in your code, as well as entries in your bib files. The glossary and references are pre-pended to the appendices as separate pages at the beginning of this environment. You, however, must write your appendices in this environment.
\begin{backmatter}

% The appendix environment creates an appendix that will be properly added to
% table of contents. All figures and tables will be properly formatted to include the
% appendix letter.
